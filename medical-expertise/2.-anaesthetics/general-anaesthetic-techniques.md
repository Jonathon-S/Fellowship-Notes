# 2.1 General Anaesthetic Techniques

## a\)  Intravenous induction and maintenance agents

A patient with any degree of clinical responsiveness, including reactivity to noxious stimuli, should receive a sedative or induc- tion agent at the time of administration of any NMBA. Patients who are deeply unconscious and unresponsive may require only a reduced dose of an induction agent if the unconscious state is caused by drugs or alcohol, which are themselves general anes- thetic agents. Patients who are unconscious because of a central nervous system insult should receive a full induction dose of an appropriate agent to attenuate adverse responses to airway manip- ulation.

Etomidate is not available in Australia

Ketamine phencyclidine derivative After an IV dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg, ketamine produces loss of awareness within 30 seconds, peaks in approximately 1 minute, and has a clinical duration of 10 to 15 minutes. As a dissociative anesthetic agent, ketamine induces a cataleptic state rather than a true unconscious state. The patient has profound anesthesia but may have her or his eyes open. Protective airway reflexes and ventilatory drive usually are preserved.

induction agent during RSI for patients with acute severe asthma or hemodynamic instability \(superior hemodynamic profile

ketamine probably has less propensity to exacerbate hemodynamic instability than any other agent. However, all sedative induction agents, including ket- amine, can provoke further hypotension or cardiovascular col- lapse in patients with profound refractory shock or those with depressed myocardial contractility and catecholamine depletion. In these settings, dosages are reduced to 50% or 25% of the usual dose.

Controversy exists regarding the use of ketamine in patients with elevated ICP because it may increase the cerebral metabolic rate, ICP, and CBF. The evidence that ketamine can produce harm in this way is conflicting, however, and may be outweighed in trauma patients because of its overall favorable hemodynamic profile \[29\]

ketamime does not appear harmful in children when given in procedural doses to patients with known elevated ICP and may actually lower ICP.

Because it may cause release of catecholamines and increase blood pressure, ketamine should be avoided in traumatic brain injury \(TBI\) patients with elevated blood pressure. However, we recommend the use of ketamine or etomidate during RSI for induction of patients with TBI and hypotension or risk factors for hypotension.

Ketamine may produce unpleasant emergence phe- nomena, especially disturbing or frightening dreams in the first 3 hours after awakening. These reactions, which are more promi- nent in adults than in children, in women than in men, in patients receiving larger doses, and in certain personality types, may be mitigated by benzodiazapine administration \[30\]

Propofol. Propofol is a highly lipophilic alkylphenol with γ-aminobutyric acid \(GABA\) receptor stimulation activity. it increasingly has been used as an induction agent during RSI.

The usual induction dose of propofol is 1.5 mg/kg IV, but reduced dosages should be used in older patients or those with hemodynamic compromise or poor cardiovascular reserve

Pro- pofol is delivered in a soybean oil and lecithin vehicle and should not be used for patients with allergies to these substances. Although propofol has traditionally been avoided in patients with egg allergy, it is likely safe unless a history of anaphylaxis to egg protein

exists. Propofol causes pain at the site of administration in as many as 60% of patients. Using a proximal \(antecubital\) vein in lieu of a distal venous injection site is the most important preven- tive measure. Pretreatment with IV lidocaine, coadministration of lidocaine mixed with propofol, and pretreatment with opioids or ketamine have all been shown to limit this common adverse reaction \[31\]

## b\)  Muscle relaxants

NMBAs are highly water-soluble, quaternary ammonium com- pounds that mimic the quaternary ammonium group on the ace- tylcholine \(ACh\) molecule. Their water solubility explains why they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier or placenta. NMBAs are divided into two main classes, depolarizing and non- depolarizing agents. The depolarizing agent succinylcholine exerts its effects by binding noncompetitively with ACh receptors on the motor endplate, causing sustained depolarization of the myocyte while preventing transmembrane potentials from reforming and resisting further stimulation from ACh. The other major class of NMBA comprises the competitive, or nondepolarizing, agents, which bind competitively to ACh receptors, preventing access by ACh and preventing muscular activity. The competitive agents are of two pharmacologically distinct types, steroid-based agents \(aminosteroid compounds\) and benzylisoquinolines. Each of these basic chemical types has distinct properties, but only aminosteroid compounds are used in the ED.

###         i\)  Depolarising

Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase to succinylmonocholine, which is a weak NMBA, and then to succinic acid and choline, which have no NMBA activity. Pseudocholinesterase is not present at the motor endplate and exerts its effects systemically before the succinylcho- line reaches the ACh receptor. Only a small amount of the suc- cinylcholine administered survives to reach the motor endplate. Succinylcholine is active at the motor endplate until it diffuses away. Decreased plasma pseudocholinesterase activity can increase the amount of succinylcholine reaching the motor endplate, pro- longing succinylcholine block, but this is of little significance in the emergency setting because the prolongation of action rarely is significant, reaching only 23 minutes at the extreme.

Uses and Dosing. Succinylcholine is rapidly active, typically producing intubating conditions within 45 seconds of adminis- tration by rapid IV bolus injection. The clinical duration of action before spontaneous respiration is 6 to 10 minutes \(see Fig. 1.11\). Full recovery of normal neuromuscular function occurs within 15 minutes.

The appropriate dose of succinyl- choline for emergency airway management is 1.5 mg/kg IV. Although the effective dose at which paralysis is achieved in 95% of patients \(ED95\) for succinylcholine paralysis is much lower \(0.3 mg/kg\), the onset of muscle paralysis is excessively long at these lower doses and is not compatible with emergency intuba- tion.

Multiple studies have confirmed that the dose of succinylcholine is based on the patient’s total body weight \(TBW\) and is not adjusted \(downward\), regardless of the degree of obesity. \[22\]

Succinylcholine can be a negative chronotrope, especially in children, and sinus bradycardia may ensue after succinylcholine administration. Sinus bradycardia is treated with atropine, if necessary, but is usually self-limiting. Some pediatric practitioners recommend pretreatment with atro- pine for children younger than 1 year, but there is no evidence for benefit, and we do not agree with this recommendation. Adults may develop bradycardia after administration of a second dose of succinylcholine.

Fasciculations. The depolarizing action of succinylcholine results in fine chaotic contractions of the muscles throughout the body for several seconds during the onset of paralysis in over 90% of patients. Muscle pain occurs in approximately 50% of patients who receive succinylcholine.

Use of 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine results in less fasciculation and less myalgia than occur with 1 mg/kg.

Hyperkalemia. Succinylcholine has been associated with severe fatal hyperkalemia when administered to patients with spe- cific predisposing clinical conditions \(Table 1.2\). The mechanism whereby severe hyperkalemia occurs is related to receptor upregu- lation on the postsynaptic muscle membrane. When a muscle is deprived of ACh stimulation for several days, receptor upregula- tion occurs, causing an increase in receptor density and a change of receptor subtypes on the muscle surface. ACh receptors are primarily K+ ion channels, and at-risk patients can have an imme- diate massive efflux of potassium as these newly recruited recep- tors are depolarized by succinylcholine.

patient’s vulnerability to succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia starts as early as 3 days but does not become sig- nificant until more than 5 days after the inciting injury or burn,

Succinylcholine remains the agent of choice for RSI in acute burn, trauma, stroke, and spinal cord injury if intubation occurs earlier than 5 days after onset of the condition.

Burns &gt; 10% BSA &gt;5 days until healed Crush Injury &gt;5 days until healed

Denervation \(stroke, spinal cord injury\) &gt;5 days until 6 mo postinjury

Intraabdominal sepsis &gt;5 days until resolution

Neuromuscular disorders - indefinitely

Succinylcholine is not contraindicated in renal failure but probably should not be used in patients with known or presumed hyperkalemia

Masseter Spasm. Succinylcholine has rarely been reported to cause masseter spasm, primarily in children and young adults. The clinical significance of this phenomenon is unclear, but adminis- tration of a competitive NMBA terminates the spasm. Severe per- sistent spasm should raise suspicion of malignant hyperthermia.

Malignant Hyperthermia. Succinylcholine has been associ- ated with malignant hyperthermia, a perplexing syndrome of rapid temperature rise and rhabdomyolysis.

Treatment consists of cessation of any potential offending agents, administration of dantrolene \(1–2.5 mg/kg IV every 5 minutes, to a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg IV\)

###         ii\)  Non-depolarising

Competitive NMBAs are classified according to their chemical structure. The aminosteroid agents includepancuronium,vecuronium,androcuronium.Vecuronium neither releases histamine nor exhibits cardiac muscarinic block- ade and is an excellent agent for the maintenance of neuromus- cular blockade when this is desirable.

study of ED intubations performed with rocuronium or succinyl- choline, first-pass intubation success was independent of the NMBA used \[24\]

Rocuronium. When a patient has a contraindication to suc- cinylcholine, rocuronium bromide is the paralytic agent of choice. At a dose of 1.0–1.2 mg/kg IV, rocuronium achieves intubating conditions similar to those of succinylcholine, lasts approximately 50 minutes

level paralysis may take 15 to 20 seconds longer than with succi- nylcholine, and the operator should allow 60 seconds to elapse before attempting intubation when rocuronium is used. There are no absolute contraindications to rocuronium. In the ED, dosing in morbidly obese patients should be based on actual TBW.



Paralysis After Intubation. After intubation, prolonged paralysis may be desired to optimize mechanical ventilation; however, current management is based on use of deep sedation and analgesia, with neuromuscular paralysis used only when nec- essary to maintain ventilatory control. If neuromuscular blockade is required, vecuronium \(0.1 mg/kg IV\) can be given, but longer term neuromuscular blockade is not to be undertaken without ensuring appropriate sedation and analgesia of the patient and a means to ensure that ongoing sedation and analgesia are adequate. Prolonged paralysis without adequate sedation occurs in up to 20% of patients following RSI in the ED.25 A sedating dose of a benzodiazepine, such as midazolam \(0.1 mg/kg IV\), combined with an opioid analgesic, such as fentanyl \(3–5 μg/kg IV\) or mor- phine \(0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV\), is required to improve patient comfort a sedative strategy using propofol \(0.1 mg/kg/min IV\) is common, especially in head-injured patients, because of its beneficial cerebroprotective profile and rapid resolution of anesthesia that allows frequent neurologic reassessments. With appropriate attention to achieving optimal sedation and analgesia, ongoing use of an NMBA usually is not necessary.
