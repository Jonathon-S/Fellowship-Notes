# 1.1 Airway

### a\)  Basic airway maintenance techniques

If a patient is unable to maintain a patent airway, the airway should be established by using airway maneuvers such as repositioning, chin lift, jaw thrust, or insertion of an oral or nasal airway.

### b\)  Oxygen delivery systems

### c\)  Bag mask ventilation

Bag-mask ventilation \(BMV\) is difficult in approximately 1 in 50 general anesthesia patients and impossible in approximately 1 in 600. BMV is difficult, however, in up to one-third of patients in whom intubation failure occurs, and difficult BMV makes the likelihood of difficult intubation four times higher and the likelihood of impossible intubation 12 times higher.

### d\)  Intubation and rapid sequence induction

Reasons to Intubate   
    1. Failure to maintain or protect the airway  
    2. Failure of ventilation or oxygenation   
    3. Anticipated clinical course and likelihood of deterioration.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN

Historically, the presence of a gag reflex has been advocated as a reliable indicator of the patient’s ability to protect the airway, but this has been definitively proven to be unreliable because the gag reflex is absent in 12% to 25% of normal adults, and there is no evidence that its presence or absence corresponds to airway protective reflexes or predicts the need for intubation.

patient’s ability to swallow or handle secretions is a more reliable indicator of airway protection. The recommended approach is to evaluate the patient’s level of con- sciousness, ability to phonate in response to voice command or query, which provides information about the integrity of the upper airway and level of consciousness, and ability to manage his or her own secretions \(eg, pooling of secretions in the orophar- ynx, absence of swallowing spontaneously or on command\). In general, a patient who requires a maneuver to establish a patent airway or who easily tolerates an oral airway requires intubation for airway protection, unless there is a temporary or readily reversible condition, such as an opioid overdose.

FAILURE OF VENTILATION OR OXYGENATION

Ventilatory failure that is not reversible by clinical means or persistent hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen supplementation is a primary indication for intubation.

Arterial blood gases \(ABGs\) generally are not required to deter- mine the patient’s need for intubation. ABG results are rarely helpful, are time-consuming to obtain, and may be misleading, causing a false sense of security and delay in intubat- ing a deteriorating patient.

The need for prolonged mechanical ventilation generally mandates intubation.

CLINICAL COURSE

Certain conditions indicate the need for intubation, even without an immediate threat to airway patency or adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. These conditions are characterized by a moder- ate to high likelihood of predictable airway deterioration or the need for intubation to facilitate a patient’s evaluation and treat- ment.

For example, a multiple trauma patient with hypotension, open femur fracture, and diffuse abdominal tenderness warrants early intubation, even if the patient is initially awake and alert, without airway injury or hypoxemia. Active resuscitation, pain control, need for invasive procedures and imaging outside of the emergency department \(ED\), and inevitable operative management dictate the need for early airway control. In addition, a patient with penetrating neck trauma

Identifying the difficult airway

With direct laryngoscopy \(DL\), if the vocal cords can be seen \(Cormack and Lehane \[CL\] grade I or II view; Fig. 1.1\), the chance of intubation success is high. However, when the glottic aperture cannot be visualized \(CL grade III or IV\), intubation success is less likely.

Fewer than 1% of stable patients undergoing DL during elec- tive anesthesia yield a grade 4 laryngoscopy   
In a recent review of emergency adult inpatient intubations, as many as 10% were considered difficult \(grade 3 or 4 CL direct view or more than three attempts required\). 12.  


. Very few of the difficult airway markers thought to limit DL access have been scientifically validated, yet applying them in combination can provide a reasonable assessment of anticipated airway difficulty.

Videolaryngoscopy, on the other hand, rarely fails to provide adequate laryngeal visual- ization, so characterization of difficult videolaryngoscopy predic- tors may not be possible.

Screening process for difficulty should be undertaken with every patient. Our recommended approach uses the mne- monic LEMONS

Evaluate 3-3-2 rule

The 3-3-2 rule requires that the patient be able to place three of his or her own fingers between the open incisors, three of his or her own fingers along the floor of the mandible beginning at the mentum, and two fingers from the laryngeal prominence to the underside of the chin

Neck mobility

Neck extension is the most important motion, but placing the patient in the full sniffing position provides the optimal laryngeal view by DL.

Modest limitations of motion do not seriously impair

DL, but severe loss of motion, as can occur in ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis, for example, may make DL impossible

Cervical spine immobilization in trauma patients artificially reduces cervical spine mobility, but DL is still highly successful inthis group of patients.7

“S” referring to the patient’s oxygen saturation. Although not a direct contributor to difficulty with DL, a low starting oxygen saturation will result in a shorter period of safe apnea and a trun- cated time to perform laryngoscopy and successful endotracheal tube placement.



Confirmation of Endotracheal Tube Placement

Immediately after intubation, the intubator should apply an end- tidal carbon dioxide \(ETco2\) detection device to the ETT and assess it through six manual ventilations.

The persistence of detected CO2 after six manual breaths indicates that the tube is within the airway, although not necessarily within the trachea. CO2 is detected with the tube in the mainstem bronchus, trachea, or supraglottic space. Correlation of ETco2 detection with the depth markings on the ETT, particularly important in pediatric patients, confirms tracheal placement.

caution is required for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest. Insufficient gas exchange may prevent CO2 detection in the exhaled air, even when the tube is correctly placed within the trachea.

When ETco2 detection is not possible, tracheal tube position can be confirmed with other techniques. One approach involves point-of-care ultrasound.

Another method of tube placement confirmation is the aspira-tion technique, based on the anatomic differences between the trachea and esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular structure with no support within its walls and is therefore collapsible when negative pressure is applied. The trachea is held patent by carti- laginous rings and thus is less likely to collapse when negative pressure is applied. Vigorous aspiration of air through the ETT with the ETT cuff deflated results in occlusion of the ETT orifices by the soft walls of the esophagus, whereas aspiration after tra- cheal placement of the tube is easy and rapid.

Bulb or syringe aspiration devices may be used in patients in cardiac arrest who have no detectable CO2. Although such devices are highly reliable at detecting esophageal intubation \(sensitivity &gt; 95%\), false-positives, in which a correctly placed tracheal tube is incorrectly identified as esophageal, can occur in up to 25% of cardiac arrest patients.

Also, a bougie can be placed through the center of an ETT to corroborate tube location further. A bougie that can be passed deeply through the tube, with little or no resistance, suggests an esophageal intubation because the bougie has likely passed beyond the tube and into the stomach.

Accordingly, ETco2 detection, with aspiration, bougie, or an ultrasound technique as backup, should be considered the primary means of ETT placement confirmation. Secondary means include physical examination findings, oximetry, and radiography.

Although chest radiography is universally recommended after ETT placement, its primary purpose is to ensure that the tube is well positioned below the cords and above the carina. A single anteroposterior chest radiograph is not sufficient to detect esophageal intubation, although esophageal intubation may be detected if the ETT is clearly outside the air shadow of the trachea. In cases in which doubt persists, a fiberoptic scope can be passed through the ETT to identify tracheal rings, another gold standard for confirmation of tracheal placement.

Main airway algorithm

?Crash airway

?Difficult airway

RSI

Failed airway if intubation unsuccessful \(more than 3 attempts by experienced operator\) or if intubation fails and can't maintain oxygenation. 

If successful, post intubation management. 

A forced to act imperative permits RSI, even in a highly diffi- cult airway situation in which the operator is not confident of the success of laryngoscopy or of sustaining oxygenation.

RSI is the cornerstone of modern emergency airway management and is defined as the nearly simultaneous administration of a potent sedative \(induction\) agent and NMBA, usually succinyl- choline or rocuronium, for the purpose of tracheal intubation. This approach provides optimal intubating conditions and has long been thought to minimize the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. A systematic review of the literature in 2007 failed to prove that RSI results in a lower incidence of aspiration than other techniques, but the authors correctly noted that virtually no studies have ever been designed to measure this precise endpoint.

### f\)  Needle/surgical cricothyroidotomy

Although early ED-based observational registries reported cricothyrotomy rates of about 1% for all intubations, more recent studies have shown a lower rate, less than 0.5%.

The combination of failure of intubation, BMV, and oxygenation in elective anesthesia practice is estimated to be exceedingly rare, roughly 1 in 30,000 elective anesthesia patients. These numbers cannot be extrapolated to populations of ED patients who are acutely ill or injured and for whom intubation is urgent and unavoidable.

If adequate oxygenation cannot be maintained with rescue BMV, the rescue technique of first resort is cricothyrotomy. If an alternative device \(ie, an EGD such as an LMA or Combitube\) is readily available, however, and the operator judges it to be an appropriate device for the patient’s anatomy, single attempt can be made to use it simultaneously with preparations for immediate cricothyrotomy as long as initiation of cricothyrotomy is not delayed.
