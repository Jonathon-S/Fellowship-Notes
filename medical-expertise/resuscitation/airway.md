# 1.1 Airway

### a\)  Basic airway maintenance techniques

If a patient is unable to maintain a patent airway, the airway should be established by using airway maneuvers such as repositioning, chin lift, jaw thrust, or insertion of an oral or nasal airway.

### b\)  Oxygen delivery systems

### c\)  Bag mask ventilation

### d\)  Intubation and rapid sequence induction

Reasons to Intubate   
    1. Failure to maintain or protect the airway  
    2. Failure of ventilation or oxygenation   
    3. Anticipated clinical course and likelihood of deterioration.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN

Historically, the presence of a gag reflex has been advocated as a reliable indicator of the patient’s ability to protect the airway, but this has been definitively proven to be unreliable because the gag reflex is absent in 12% to 25% of normal adults, and there is no evidence that its presence or absence corresponds to airway protective reflexes or predicts the need for intubation.

patient’s ability to swallow or handle secretions is a more reliable indicator of airway protection. The recommended approach is to evaluate the patient’s level of con- sciousness, ability to phonate in response to voice command or query, which provides information about the integrity of the upper airway and level of consciousness, and ability to manage his or her own secretions \(eg, pooling of secretions in the orophar- ynx, absence of swallowing spontaneously or on command\). In general, a patient who requires a maneuver to establish a patent airway or who easily tolerates an oral airway requires intubation for airway protection, unless there is a temporary or readily reversible condition, such as an opioid overdose.

FAILURE OF VENTILATION OR OXYGENATION

Ventilatory failure that is not reversible by clinical means or persistent hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen supplementation is a primary indication for intubation.

Arterial blood gases \(ABGs\) generally are not required to deter- mine the patient’s need for intubation. ABG results are rarely helpful, are time-consuming to obtain, and may be misleading, causing a false sense of security and delay in intubat- ing a deteriorating patient.

The need for prolonged mechanical ventilation generally mandates intubation.

CLINICAL COURSE

Certain conditions indicate the need for intubation, even without an immediate threat to airway patency or adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. These conditions are characterized by a moder- ate to high likelihood of predictable airway deterioration or the need for intubation to facilitate a patient’s evaluation and treat- ment.

For example, a multiple trauma patient with hypotension, open femur fracture, and diffuse abdominal tenderness warrants early intubation, even if the patient is initially awake and alert, without airway injury or hypoxemia. Active resuscitation, pain control, need for invasive procedures and imaging outside of the emergency department \(ED\), and inevitable operative management dictate the need for early airway control. In addition, a patient with penetrating neck trauma
